    "#  Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- I know nothing about Basketball so let's see how this goes\n",
    "- The feature engineering seriously needs to be worked on\n",
    "- Seeds do not change during the season\n",
    "- Predict the probability of the lower TeamID winning\n",
    "- Only rely on given data (just to make it easier)\n",
    "- Possibly make a df for team statistics throughout the years (like if a team has been has been active since 1990, you do 1 row for that team per year). If you do this, make a separate df for women.\n",
    "- Possibly make a df that's just for games where it shows who won.\n",
    "- Somehow combine these into something a model can use to train on? This I need to think a lot about. If I have 3 different dataframes, with each giving me different kinds of data, how do I make a ML model that can train on those and predict the mashups of March Madness in the correct format?\n",
    "- Because of the last bullet, try to not do any feature engineering or creating dataframes until you think about how a model can use it.\n",
    "- After making dataframes, check dtypes\n",

    "- **Slot:** slot that gives information on the seed from the winning or favored team\n",
    "  - for play-ins, it is a 3 character string where the last 2 numbers are the winning seed. for regular tournaments, it is a 4 character string where the second character tells you the round, and the last character (or 2) tells you the expected seed of the favored team\n",
    "- **StrongSeed:** seed that's strong\n",
    "  - last 2 characters are the seed\n",

    "- **DayNum**: higher the number, the better the team is because they lasted longer\n",
    "  - number\n",
    "- **WTeamID:** winning team id\n",
    "  - 4 digit number\n",
    "- **WScore:** winning score\n",
    "  - number\n",
    "- **LTeamID:** losting team id\n",
    "  - 4 digit number\n",

    "- Win/lose ratio (for each team)\n",
    "- Score of left team - score of right team difference (for that game)\n",
    "- Calculate ELO rating per team\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target\n",
    "- I think a good target would be to make it so if each row is for 2 competing teams, show a 1 if the left team won, and a 0 if they lost. Then, the ML model will predict this and show a probability for it.\n",
    "- I saw someone did it where instead of it being a 1 if they actually won, they did it so that the smaller TeamID is 1 and the other is 0. Not sure which route to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Actually, maybe just make it into 1 df.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataframe Structure\n",
    "- **ID:** of team mashup (YYYY_T1ID_T2ID) from SampleSubmissionStage1\n",
    "- **Year:** YYYY taken from SampleSubmissionStage1\n",
    "\n",

    "- **SeedDiff:** taken from MNCAATourneySeeds from subtracting the left seed from the right\n",
    "- **FavoredSeed:** taken from MNCAATourneySlots where it's 1 if the left team is the favored seed (if it's all 1 then remove this)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RegELODiff:** which uses the data from (M/W)RegularSeasonDetailedResults to calculate the difference in ELO\n",
    "- **TourneyELODiff:** which uses the data from (M/W)NCAATourneyDetailedResults to calculate the difference in ELO\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pred:** where 1 is if the left team won the game or 0 if they didn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "# WHAT?????????????\n",
    "- Please review all of the code and figure out exactly how the feature selection works\n",
    "- why are you clipping predictions\n",
    "- why use a regressor instead of a classifier\n",
    "- why are missing values filled with -1\n",
    "- is the standard scaler scaling any categorical columns??\n",
    "- why are we fitting on X and then predicting with X? is this not the same as fitting with training data and then predicting with training data?"
